# Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard development workflow for this project.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This runs in preview mode with Storyblok integration enabled.

## Storyblok Integration

The project is connected to Storyblok using access tokens. These are loaded from environment variables in [astro.config.mjs](mdc:astro.config.mjs).

To generate TypeScript types for Storyblok components:
```
npm run storyblok:generate-types
```

## Build Process

- For preview builds: `npm run build:preview`
- For production builds: `npm run build:production`

The main difference is that preview uses SSR (server-side rendering) while production uses static generation.

## Code Formatting

The project uses Prettier for code formatting, configured in [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc).

## TypeScript

TypeScript configuration is in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json). Custom type definitions for the project are in [src/types/](mdc:src/types).
