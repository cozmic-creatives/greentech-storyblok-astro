# Deployment and Infrastructure

This project supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) modes.

## Docker Support

The project includes Docker configurations for both modes:
- [Dockerfile.static](mdc:Dockerfile.static) - For static site generation
- [Dockerfile.ssr](mdc:Dockerfile.ssr) - For server-side rendering
- [.dockerignore](mdc:.dockerignore) - Docker ignore file

## Nginx Configuration

Nginx configurations for serving the site are available in the [nginx/](mdc:nginx) directory.

## Environment Handling

The project uses environment variables for configuration:
- `PUBLIC_ENV=preview` - For development and preview mode (uses SSR)
- `PUBLIC_ENV=production` - For production mode (uses static generation)

This is configured in the [astro.config.mjs](mdc:astro.config.mjs) file, which sets different output modes based on the environment.
